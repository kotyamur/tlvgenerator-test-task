### I present to your attention a small application for creating a list of questions.

To work, you will first need to log in, and then you will get to the page of the list of all questions, where there will already be an example of some questions that you can delete and use the "create new" button to create new questions.
You can also edit your questions.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
